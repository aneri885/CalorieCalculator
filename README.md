# Calorie Calculator
Android app that calculates a persons Basal Metabolic Rate and recommended daily caloric intake.
Factors in sex, height, weight, and age to calculate BMR. Afterwards, uses that BMR and multiplies it by a constant depending on what is entered for active days per week. Added functionality to calculate the users BMI as well. Both Basal Metabolic Rate and Body Mass Index are important factors to determining a person's overall health. 
Enter the person's name to save the entry to the system. You can either view all entries or view only the healthy entries, which are those with BMI's between 18.4 and 24.9. Afterwards, you can click on an entry to view a graph displaying how much that person needs to eat to maintain weight, how much they should eat to lose 1 lb a week, and how much they should eat to gain 1 lb a week.
